Dengue Fever Detection Project with Decision Tree 🌿🩺

This project aims to detect dengue fever using Decision Tree algorithm. By analyzing medical data and visible symptoms, this model can classify whether a patient is infected with dengue or healthy. High accuracy is expected to support early detection and rapid treatment.

🔍Main Features:

Decision Tree: An algorithm used for classification based on medical data patterns.
Early Detection: Helps recognize dengue symptoms faster.
High Accuracy: The system is designed to achieve optimal accuracy.
🎯 Objective: Assist medical personnel in detecting and responding to dengue cases more quickly and effectively.
